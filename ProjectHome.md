Since the project [wiifit](http://code.google.com/p/wiifit) is written in Python, which is (at least for me) not easy to read, and it has been inactive since 2010 and since it has some bug that messes up about 0.5% of the values of bmi & weight in kg I created this project.

I think its much easier to read (and therefore extend) and I couldn't find any wrong values in its output.
